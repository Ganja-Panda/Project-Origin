## üåç Vision

Humanity has mapped the genome. We‚Äôve mapped the Earth.  
But we‚Äôve never mapped *ourselves* ‚Äî our shared story as a single species.  

**Project Origin** is a free, open educational VR platform that unites science, history, and empathy.  
It visualizes human ancestry, migration, and adaptation from the dawn of Homo sapiens to the modern day ‚Äî personalized through DNA data and archaeological evidence.

Its mission is simple:  
> To show every human being that there is no ‚Äúus vs. them.‚Äù  
> Only *us* ‚Äî one adaptable species under many suns.

## üï∞Ô∏è Why Now

- **Open genetic data:** Public projects like 1000 Genomes, Max Planck, and P√§√§bo‚Äôs ancient DNA archives provide global, free datasets.  
- **Affordable VR hardware:** Meta Quest, HTC Vive, and Apple Vision Pro make immersive learning mainstream.  
- **AI & machine learning:** Modern AI can reconstruct ancient environments, languages, and human migration patterns.  
- **Cultural division:** The world is more polarized than ever. We need tools that re-teach shared humanity.  

The infrastructure to connect us already exists ‚Äî it simply needs to be assembled.

## üß© System Overview

### **1. Data Layer**
- Open-source genetic datasets (23andMe summaries, 1000 Genomes, ancient DNA references)  
- Archaeological & linguistic databases  
- Climate and environmental data from NASA / NOAA  

### **2. Processing Layer (Python + Open AI)**
- Converts ancestry data into real-time migration routes  
- Maps adaptation traits (climate, diet, culture)  
- Generates personal lineage paths (opt-in DNA input only)  

### **3. Visualization Layer (Unity / Unreal Engine)**
- 3D Earth with evolving geography and population movements  
- Narrated VR experiences ‚Äî *‚ÄúYour ancestors left Africa 60,000 years ago‚Ä¶‚Äù*  
- Specialized modes:
  - ü™ñ **Veterans:** resilience and lineage therapy  
  - üß† **Elders:** memory reconstruction for Alzheimer‚Äôs therapy  
  - üéì **Students:** unbiased history education  

### **4. Ethics & Privacy**
- Fully open-source, no ads, no data harvesting  
- Personal DNA stays local or encrypted  
- Non-commercial use only ‚Äî free for life

## üåê Open Licensing & Sustainability

- Licensed under **Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0** ‚Äî free to use for education and research.  
- Commercial licensing (for museums, institutions, or hardware bundles) may sustain hosting ‚Äî never restricts public access.  
- All code, datasets, and documentation remain **open and forkable**.

## üß† Conceptual Roadmap

1. **MVP** ‚Äì Use 23andMe ancestry summaries + Python script to generate basic migration maps.  
2. **VR Prototype** ‚Äì Import GeoJSON into Unity/Unreal to visualize global movement.  
3. **Partnership Phase** ‚Äì Collaborate with museums, educators, and geneticists.  
4. **Therapeutic Expansion** ‚Äì Build adaptive modules for veteran and elder care.  
5. **Public Launch** ‚Äì Open educational distribution via SteamVR and schools.

## üïäÔ∏è Call to Action

We have the data.  
We have the technology.  
We need only the unity of purpose.

**If you believe education, empathy, and technology can bridge humanity‚Äôs divisions ‚Äî join us.**

## ‚ö° Quickstart (Prototype)


# **Step 1 ‚Äî Generate lineage GeoJSON**
```bash
python scripts/origin_map.py --ancestry examples/ancestry_example.json --lookup examples/region_lookup.csv --out examples/your_lineage.geojson
```
# **Step 2 ‚Äî Start a local server**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
# **Step 3 ‚Äî View in browser**
Open http://localhost:8000/examples/viewer.html
*(Leaflet will load your_lineage.geojson and plot ancestry points)*
