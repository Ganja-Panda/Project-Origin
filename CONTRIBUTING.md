# Contributing to Project Origin

Thanks for wanting to help. Keep it simple:

## Ways to contribute
- Improve docs, diagrams, and datasets.
- Add code for data parsing, mapping, or VR visualization (Unity/Unreal).
- Open issues with concrete suggestions or bugs.
- Share public/open data sources we should integrate.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Keep PRs small and focused.
3. Include a short description + screenshots when relevant.
4. Donâ€™t commit secrets or raw personal DNA data (ever).

## Code style
- Python: PEP8-ish, type hints when practical.
- Keep scripts under `/scripts`, examples under `/examples`.

## Ethics & privacy
- Use only public/open datasets or data that you own and consent to share.
- No health inference, no doxxing, no scraping private sources.
